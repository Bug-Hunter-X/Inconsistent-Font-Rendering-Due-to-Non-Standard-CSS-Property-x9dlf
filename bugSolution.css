The solution is to remove the invalid `font-size-adjust` property. If fine-tuning font size across different browsers is needed, alternative methods should be explored such as using specific font families known for consistent rendering and controlling other font properties such as `font-stretch` or `font-weight`.

```css
div {
  /* font-size-adjust: 0.5;  Removed */
  font-family: 'Arial', sans-serif; /* Example: using a specific font family */
}
```
